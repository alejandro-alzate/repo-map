# *Repository Map*
A map to guide you through my mess. Cut and dry I really don't think my repos are the best to navigate through, so better ease the chore with ease.

Hello guys I'm alejandro-alzate I'm a computer enthusiast, I generally code for fun and I share my projects tools and libraries that I've developed over the time.

My biggest flaw is that I'm not the most ordered guy on existence per say, when there's something on my mind I just slap a folder for it as fast as I can before I lose it, this is not the best practice I'm aware but I'm working on it...

This repo just highlight my projects that at least hold any water or are worth checking on my opinion or sometimes I just want to share them so people can take a look.
